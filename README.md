# OpenRelik Worker: capa

## Description

This OpenRelik worker utilizes **capa** to identify capabilities in executable files.

**What is capa?**

Capa is an open-source tool developed by Mandiant (formerly FireEye) that detects capabilities in executable files. You run it against a PE file, ELF, shellcode, or .NET module, and it tells you what it thinks the program can do. For example, it might suggest that the file is a backdoor, can install services, or relies on HTTP to communicate. For more details, visit the [official capa repository](https://github.com/mandiant/capa).
